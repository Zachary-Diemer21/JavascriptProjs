//Object oriented Programming in Javascript

// Define the Person constructor
var Person = function(firstName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
};

// Add a couple of methods to Person.prototype
Person.prototype.walk = function(){
  console.log("I am walking!");
};

Person.prototype.sayHello = function(){
  console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.firstName);
};

// Define the Student constructor
function Student(firstName, subject) {
  // Call the parent constructor, making sure (using call)
  // that "this" is set correctly during the call
  Person.call(this, firstName);

  // Initialize our Student-specific properties
  this.subject = subject;
}

// Create a Student.prototype object that inherits from Person.prototype.
// Note: A common error here is to use "new Person()" to create the
// Student.prototype. That's incorrect for several reasons, not least 
// that we don't have anything to give Person for the "firstName" 
// argument. The correct place to call Person is above, where we call 
// it from Student.
Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype); // See note below

// Set the "constructor" property to refer to Student
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

// Replace the "sayHello" method
Student.prototype.sayHello = function(){
  console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.firstName + ". I'm studying "
              + this.subject + ".");
};

// Add a "sayGoodBye" method
Student.prototype.sayGoodBye = function(){
  console.log("Goodbye!");
};

// Example usage:
var student1 = new Student("Janet", "Applied Physics");
student1.sayHello();   // "Hello, I'm Janet. I'm studying Applied Physics."
student1.walk();       // "I am walking!"
student1.sayGoodBye(); // "Goodbye!"

// Check that instanceof works correctly
console.log(student1 instanceof Person);  // true 
console.log(student1 instanceof Student); // true

//Making sure, this, points to the right thing
var Person = function(firstName) {
  if (this instanceof Person) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
  } else {
    return new Person(firstName);
  }
}

/*Student does not need to know how the Person class's walk() method is implemented, but still can use that method; the Student class doesn't need to explicitly define that method unless we want to change it. This is called encapsulation, by which every class packages data and methods into a single unit.*/

//PolyMorphism in Javascript:
//different classes can define methods with the same name; 
//methods are scoped to the class in which they're defined,
